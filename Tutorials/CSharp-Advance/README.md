## Intermediate Language Features

Building upon the foundations of OOP, this module explores features that enhance code flexibility and reusability.

- **Delegates and Events:** Use delegates as type-safe function pointers to enable event-driven programming and decoupled communication between objects.  
- **Generics:** Create classes, methods, and interfaces that work with different data types while maintaining type safety.  
- **Extension Methods:** "Add" new methods to existing types without modifying their original source code, useful for extending third-party libraries.  
- **Interfaces:** Deepen your understanding of interfaces as contracts that define methods a class must implement, enabling polymorphic behavior.  
- **Enums:** Use enum types to create a set of named integer constants, making code more readable and maintainable.

## Asynchronous Programming

This module is critical for building responsive applications that don't block the UI during long-running operations.

- **async and await:** Modern C# approach for writing asynchronous code, simplifying complex multithreading scenarios.  
- **Tasks and Task Parallel Library (TPL):** Task objects represent async operations, and TPL allows parallel processing.  
- **Thread Safety and Concurrency:** Handle shared data in multithreaded environments to prevent race conditions and other issues.

## Data Access and LINQ

Learn powerful tools for querying and manipulating data from various sources.

- **LINQ (Language-Integrated Query):** Query collections, databases, XML, and other sources using a consistent, SQL-like syntax.  
- **Query Syntax vs. Method Syntax:** Different ways to write LINQ queries and when to use each.  
- **Entity Framework Core (EF Core):** An ORM that simplifies database access by working with C# objects instead of raw SQL commands.

## Modern C# and Performance

Explore recent language features that improve code conciseness and performance.

- **Lambda Expressions:** Concise way to write anonymous functions, often used with LINQ and delegates.  
- **Records:** Create immutable, data-centric objects with built-in functionality.  
- **Tuples and Deconstruction:** Group multiple values in tuples and deconstruct them for easy access.  
- **Span and Memory:** Low-level, high-performance types for efficient mem
