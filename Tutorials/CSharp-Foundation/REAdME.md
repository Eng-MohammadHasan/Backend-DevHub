## Control Flow and Loops

Learn how to control the flow of your program's execution.

- **If Statements:** Executing code based on a condition  
- **Switches:** A concise alternative to long if-else chains  
- **Logical Operators:** Combining multiple conditions (`&&` and `||`)  
- **While Loops:** Repeating code while a condition is true  
- **For Loops:** Repeating code a specific number of times  
- **Nested Loops:** Using loops inside other loops  
- **Projects:**  
  - Number Guessing Game  
  - Rock-Paper-Scissors Game  
  - Calculator Program (combining multiple concepts)

## Arrays and Methods

This section introduces more advanced ways to store data and write reusable code.

- **Arrays:** Storing a fixed-size collection of data  
- **Foreach Loop:** Simplified iteration over arrays  
- **Methods:** Creating reusable blocks of code  
- **Return Keyword:** Getting a value back from a method  
- **Method Overloading:** Creating multiple methods with the same name  
- **Params Keyword:** Passing a variable number of arguments  
- **Exception Handling:** Gracefully managing errors  
- **Conditional Operator:** A shorthand for simple if-else statements  
- **String Interpolation:** Modern way to format strings  
- **Multidimensional Arrays:** Arrays with more than one dimension

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Dive into the core principles of OOP in C#.

- **Classes:** Blueprint for creating objects  
- **Objects:** Instances of a class  
- **Constructors:** Special methods to initialize objects  
- **Static:** Members belonging to the class itself  
- **Overloaded Constructors:** Multiple constructors for a class  
- **Inheritance:** Creating new classes from existing ones  
- **Abstract Classes:** Classes that cannot be instantiated directly  
- **Array of Objects:** Storing objects in an array  
- **Objects as Arguments:** Passing objects to methods  
- **Method Overriding:** Providing a new implementation for an inherited method  
- **ToString Method:** Returns string representation of an object  
- **Polymorphism:** Object taking many forms  
- **Interfaces:** Defining contracts for classes

## Data Structures and Advanced Features

This final section explores more complex topics.

- **Lists:** Flexible, resizable collection  
- **List of Objects:** Storing objects in a list  
- **Getters & Setters:** Controlling access to properties  
- **Auto-implemented Properties:** Short-hand for properties  
- **Enums:** Named integer constants  
- **Generics:** Reusable code with different data types  
- **Multithreading:** Performing multiple operations at once
